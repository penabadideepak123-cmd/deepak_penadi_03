  <h1>CP1406/CP5638 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
  <p><strong>Name:</strong>Deepak Penabadi</p>

  <h2>Goal</h2>
  <p>
    The goal of the 100SMILES Dental Care website is to <strong>increase new patient appointments by 25% within six months</strong>
    by creating a modern, user-friendly online presence for the clinic that improves discoverability and simplifies booking. The website will
    communicate the clinic’s decades-long local presence, range of services, and staff credentials so potential patients feel confident booking care.
  </p>

  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
  <p>
    The website’s success will be measured with specific, quantifiable metrics:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Online appointment conversions:</strong> A 25% increase in bookings made via the website or email booking link compared to the baseline monthly average.</li>
      <li><strong>User engagement:</strong> Average session duration of at least 2 minutes on service and team pages and a reduced bounce rate for key pages.</li>
      <li><strong>Lead generation:</strong> Growth in the number of contact-form submissions and email enquiries (tracked monthly).</li>
      <li><strong>Local visibility:</strong> Improved ranking for local searches such as “Razole dentist” or “Razole dental clinic” (target: enter top 5 for key terms).</li>
      <li><strong>Promotional uptake:</strong> Redemption of email booking 20% discount for first-time visitors (tracked via promotional code or mention).</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Target Audience</h2>
  <p>
    The website is primarily for:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Local families and parents</strong> seeking children’s dental care and preventive services (first-visit reassurance, pediatric care).</li>
      <li><strong>Working adults and retirees</strong> who need routine check-ups, restorative or cosmetic procedures and value trustworthy, long-term care.</li>
    </ul>
    To suit this audience, the site will:
    <ul>
      <li>Use a calm, trust-building light palette (white and soft blue), clear headings and large, legible fonts for older visitors.</li>
      <li>Feature staff photos and friendly bios to build rapport and reduce appointment anxiety.</li>
      <li>Place calls-to-action (Book Appointment, Contact Us) prominently on all pages and ensure mobile-first usability for busy users.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
